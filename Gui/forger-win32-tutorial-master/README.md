# theForger's Win32 API Tutorial

## Introduction

This repository is an unofficial repo for [theForger's Win32 API Tutorial](http://www.winprog.org/tutorial/) [source code](http://bit.ly/2ntziDq). It's reproduced here so I don't forget about it and so I can easily reference it using Git.

## Changes

The solution and projects have been upgraded to VS 2019 Community Edition, and the source code successfully compiles, but outdated compiler and linker flags will generate warnings during builds. These warnings aren't anything serious and don't stop the builds, but I will update the flags soon to remedy the issue.
